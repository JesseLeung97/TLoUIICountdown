# Countdown to The Last of Us Part II

This countdown to The Last of Us Part II was written using the ReactJS framework.  Inspiration and basic code for the countdown component comes from [Kristin Baumann's tutorial](https://medium.com/@kristin_baumann/react-countdown-6455838b6faf) for medium.  The background image and The Last of Us Part II logo were taken from the official Playstation website.  Other than the particle filter, all animations are written in CSS.

##Usage

`npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.
`npm run build`
